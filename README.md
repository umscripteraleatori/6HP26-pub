- Use the correct connector pinout for the vehicle or bench rig.  
- Select the right protocol and module ID in the toolbox.  
- Set session logging and output directories.

Typical workflows

Read and backup TCU
Objective: create a full backup before any write operation.

Steps:
1. Power vehicle. Keep ignition in ON or accessory as required.  
2. Connect CAN interface to OBD-II port or to bench connector.  
3. Start toolkit and select target module (ZF 6HP26).  
4. Choose "Read full flash" and "Read EEPROM/FRAM" options.  
5. Start session and let the toolkit complete the read.  
6. Save session with timestamp and module part number.  

Expected artifacts:
- backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.bin ‚Äî Full flash image.  
- eeprom-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.bin ‚Äî EEPROM contents.  
- frammem-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.bin ‚Äî FRAM contents.  
- log-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt ‚Äî Operation log with transport traces.

Flash TCU firmware
Objective: safely apply a firmware or calibration image to the TCU.

Preparation:
- Verify the target file compatibility with the module part and hardware.  
- Ensure backup exists.  
- Disable systems that draw heavy current during flash (HVAC fans, lights).  

Steps:
1. Select operation "Flash full image" or "Flash calibration only."  
2. Pick file: tcu-firmware-XXXXX.bin or calibration-XXXXX.cal.  
3. Put the module into programming mode if required. The toolkit prompts for steps.  
4. Start flashing. Monitor progress on the UI.  
5. Do not interrupt power during write.  
6. After flash, run "Verify" to confirm CRC or checksum.  
7. If verification passes, perform module reset and run adaptation reset if required.

Typical flash artifacts:
- flashed-image-YYYYMMDD.bin  
- verify-report-YYYYMMDD.txt  

Read and write EEPROM / FRAM
Purpose: modify learned values, VIN, and small persistent tables.

Actions:
- Read full EEPROM and FRAM to offboard files.  
- Use built-in editors to search and edit specific tables (VIN, serial, learned clutches).  
- Write back edited files. Use verify mode after write.

Common edits:
- VIN rewrite after module swap.  
- Clear adaptation flags for solenoid learning.  
- Adjust torque converter lockup thresholds stored in EEPROM.

Adaptations and resetting learned values
Adaptation management is critical when you swap a TCU or rebuild a transmission.

Key adaptation items:
- Shift adaptation tables (short term, long term).  
- Torque converter clutch learn counter.  
- Solenoid calibration offsets.  

Actions:
- Read adaptation values. Export to CSV for tracking.  
- Reset short-term and long-term tables if you replace mechanical parts.  
- Run relearn procedures while driving or on a dyno per the service manual.

Shift map and torque control edits
Calibrators use the toolkit to tune shift quality and performance.

Work items:
- Shift point RPM thresholds.  
- Line pressure scaling vs. throttle.  
- Torque management tables to protect clutches and gearbox.  
- Lockup clutch engagement curve.

Editing process:
1. Export base calibration. Work on a copy.  
2. Use sample-calibrations as a reference for scaling and units.  
3. Validate units: RPM, kPa, torque Nm, percentage.  
4. Upload new calibration to a test module first.  
5. Drive test with data logging and tune iteratively.

VIN and immobilizer programming
VIN and immobilizer entries often reside in EEPROM or dedicated security area.

Procedure:
- Read EEPROM to capture existing values.  
- Use the toolkit's VIN editor to set the correct VIN string.  
- Immobilizer programming may require PIN codes and gateway commands.  
- For Ford, some modules require the vehicle's BCM to allow VIN changes. Follow the tool prompts to coordinate BCM and TCU actions.

Recovery and bootloader modes
The toolkit includes recovery methods if a TCU fails during flash.

Recovery options:
- Bootloader mode via UART or CAN ISP.  
- Forced boot via pinjumper on bench.  
- Secondary bootloader using ISP over CAN.  
- CRC-based partial recovery to reflash only corrupted sectors.

Recovery steps:
1. Connect to module via bench connector and enable bootloader mode.  
2. Use the "Bootloader Flash" routine in the toolkit.  
3. Flash a minimal boot image first, then the full firmware.  
4. Run a verify and then full system check.

File types and formats
Understand file types included in releases and produced by the toolkit.

Common file types:
- .bin ‚Äî Raw flash or binary image.  
- .cal ‚Äî Calibration file with structured tables and metadata.  
- .eep ‚Äî EEPROM dump.  
- .frm ‚Äî FRAM dump.  
- .log ‚Äî Plain text operation/log file.  
- .csv ‚Äî Exported tables for offline editing.  
- .hex ‚Äî Intel HEX firmware format (occasionally used).  

Naming conventions:
- Use timestamps: module-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.ext.  
- Include module part number or VIN in filename for clarity.

Protocols and transport layers
The toolkit supports common diagnostic and programming transports.

Primary transports:
- CAN ISO-TP (ISO 15765) for UDS service access.  
- UDS (ISO 14229) services for security, erase, write, transfer.  
- KWP2000 on K-Line for older bench setups.  
- Proprietary ZF bootloader over CAN for low-level flashing.  
- UART for direct MCU bootloader access on some boards.

Common UDS services used:
- DiagnosticSessionControl (0x10) to enter programming session.  
- SecurityAccess (0x27) for seed/key authentication.  
- RoutineControl (0x31) for erase and program routines.  
- RequestDownload (0x34) and TransferData (0x36) to write partitions.  
- RequestUpload (0x35) to read partitions.

Security and authentication
Some TCUs require security keys before allowing write operations.

Key management:
- The toolkit implements a seed/key algorithm for supported modules.  
- For modules with stronger security, the release may include helper scripts for offline key calculation.  
- For dealer-only security, you must use OEM tools or pass a security protocol via the vehicle network.

Logging and diagnostics
Logging helps trace operations and diagnose issues.

Log types:
- Transport trace (CAN frames with timestamps).  
- Operation log (actions taken by the toolkit).  
- Error log (failed handshakes, timeouts).  
- CSV data logs for sensor and parameter traces.

Use the toolkit to record all sessions. Store logs with backups. Correlate logs with capture files from CAN sniffers when diagnosing.

Scripting and automation
The toolkit exposes a CLI for scripted flows.

Sample CLI usage:
- Read full flash:
  flasher-6hp26 --read-flash --output backup.bin
- Flash image:
  flasher-6hp26 --flash-image firmware.bin --verify
- Batch flash multiple modules:
  toolkit-cli.sh --batch batch-list.txt

Batch operations:
- Provide a CSV with VIN, module ID, file path.  
- Run the batch script to flash identical firmware across multiple modules.  
- Use the --dry-run option to verify steps before making changes.

Troubleshooting and recovery recipes

Symptom: Read fails with timeouts
- Check physical connections and pinout.  
- Confirm interface driver loaded.  
- Lower CAN speed to match module's bus speed.  
- Try direct bench connection to module CAN pins.

Symptom: Flash fails mid-write
- Ensure stable 12V supply. Use a battery charger or bench supply.  
- Retry firmware upload via bootloader mode.  
- Use recovery image if full flash fails.

Symptom: Module does not respond after flash
- Power cycle module and vehicle.  
- Enter bootloader mode and reflash minimal image.  
- Reapply calibration and perform adaptation reset.  
- Restore backup if necessary.

Symptom: VIN or immobilizer write fails
- Verify security access sequence succeeded.  
- Ensure BCM or other gateway modules allow vehicle network programming.  
- Use OEM service mode where needed.

Data analysis and tuning advice
Work with small, controlled changes. Validate each step with a data log. Use clear metrics to measure shift quality:

Key metrics:
- Shift time (ms).  
- Torque drop during shift (Nm).  
- Line pressure delta (kPa).  
- Slip time on torque converter lockup.

Use A/B testing:
- Keep a copy of baseline calibration.  
- Change one table or curve at a time.  
- Drive in repeatable conditions and collect logs.  
- Revert if you observe regressions.

Common calibration targets
- Smoothness: reduce aggressive torque reduction during shifts.  
- Durability: increase line pressure in high-load ranges.  
- Economy: change lockup strategy for highway cruise.

Bench vs vehicle testing
Bench tests provide safe environment for low-level flashing and initial checks. Vehicle testing validates real-world performance. Follow a staged validation plan:
1. Bench boot verification.  
2. Passive CAN trace during key-on engine-off.  
3. Static actuation tests with engine off.  
4. Low-speed test drive.  
5. Full-range validation.

Audit trail and compliance
Keep a full audit trail for each operation. This includes:
- Operator name.  
- VIN or module serial.  
- Backup filenames.  
- Files flashed.  
- Logs and verification reports.

This record aids service history and helps recover from issues.
